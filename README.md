# Edvart

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the initial task a data scientist or data
analyst undertakes when they obtain new data. EDA refers to the critical
process of conducting preliminary investigations on data to uncover patterns,
spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and verify assumptions with the help of
summary statistics and graphical representations.

The Effective Data Visualization and Reporting Tool (Edvart for short) is a
tool that generates a report in the form of a Jupyter notebook, containing
various analyses of the input data.

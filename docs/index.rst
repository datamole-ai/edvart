EDVART
================================

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a very initial task a data scientist
or data analyst does when he reaches new data.
EDA refers to the critical process of performing
initial investigations on data to discover patterns, to spot
anomalies, to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help
of summary statistics and graphical representations.

EDVART serves for speeding up EDA and for
creating Data analysis reports.
